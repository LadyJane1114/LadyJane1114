<br/>
<p>I'm Jane, or Lady Jane as people have come to know me. I am a student at NSCC about to graduate with a diploma in IT Programming, as well as an author and tabletop games facilitator. Through attempting to merge my love of storytelling and technology, I've discovered a passion for UI/UX development. I believe that every good application should tell a story, intuitively guiding users through its narrative and making complex actions feel natural and purposeful. I create websites and applications that people genuinely enjoy engaging with.</p>
